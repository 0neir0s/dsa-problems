# DSA Problems
A list of interesting problems and solutions

* [Sum of products of all combination taken (1 to n) at a time](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-products-combination-taken-1-n-time/) : sum-product-combination.py


* [Path with maximum gold](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-gold/): maximum-gold-path.py - A good example for backtracking/dfs based approach with no possibility of DP/caching

* [Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix): longest-increasing-path.py - A tough example of dfs like problem but whose property can be exploited to allow caching/DP

* [Subset Sum/Knapsack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/subset-sum-problem-dp-25/): subset-sum-problem.py - Covers subset sum, checking if change assuming an unlimited supply of coins, and finally the 0-1 knapsack problem

* [Peak Element/Next larger element to right](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-peak-in-a-given-array/): peak-element-next-larger-right.py - Covers next larger/smaller elements to the left/right as well as 1D and 2D peak element finder (binary search like)
